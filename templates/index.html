    <p>Here are two example Suggestion Box applications that are the similar,
      but provide two different implementations of paging.
    </p>

    <p><b><a href="/unique/">Unique</a></b>: Creates a unique value for each
      suggestion and uses that as the property to query on when paging.
    </p>

    <p><b><a href="/cursor/">Cursor</a></b>: Uses a cursor returned by queries
      which are ordered by the 'created' property to do paging without creating
      an extra property that is guaranteed unique.
    </p>
